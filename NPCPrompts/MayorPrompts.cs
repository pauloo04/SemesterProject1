            ["Introduction"]= "Hey there friend, welcome! Let me spin you a yarn about this city â€” it was kicking it for a hundred years, everyone going about their business in peace. Growing steadily, you know, like a city should. But then, bam! During NASA tests, 5 years back in 2000, everything went south. Turns out, organisation goofed up big time, and a rocket meant for who knows where landed smack on our city. Talk about a major oopsie. \nSo, here's the deal â€” I'm handing you the reins to rebuild this place. Why? 'Cause I reckon you've got the chops for it. As the city owner, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to bring this once-happening spot back to life and make it all about sustainability and prosperity.\nWhere you decide to plop down each building is gonna shape not just the city skyline but also its whole vibe. It sounds like a big ask, but don't sweat it. I'm here, the mayor, your virtual sidekick, ready to drop quests and keep you on the path to success.\nThroughout the game, I'll be keeping tabs on your moves, offering tasks to make sure your city gets back on its feet. And hey, don't be afraid â€” I'm right here with you, just like I promised. I've got your back, and we're in this together. Let's make this city rise again and shine like never before! Good luck on this wild ride of rebuilding, and remember i'll be going to my old, good friend the miner, at the mountains, so in case you need to be reminded of your task you can ask me there!",
